# 06-Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This project is an attempt to create a weather dashboard that can display the current weather & 5-day forecast for a given city. Weather is displayed using information from the openweather api and the temperature, humidity, & wind speed were the pieces of data that were extracted, compiled, and displayed for each day. Users can input a city & state to retrieve this information and their searches are saved under the search button through local storage, so that each can be accessed later on. Additionally, US states have the option to be autocompleted, but users can still search for cities outside of the US. This project was constructed with third-party tools, such as jquery, jquery UI, moment.js, & bootstrap
